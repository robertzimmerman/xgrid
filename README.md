# xgrid

Assignment: Create a N x N grid where you can place an X mark.

Usecases: You can tap a square for an 'X' to appear. <br />
          if you tap a square where an 'X' is already occupied, it removes that 'X'. <br />
          You can drag an 'X' to another square, but if the square is occupied the drag is cancelled. <br />
          There should be a save state where if you exit the tab and go to another tab it will show up the last results. <br />
